# Lightweight Django

## My personal trainig about Django (and a bit of Tornado, too)

I'm reading and learning a lot about Django in this publishing. Interesting
thoughts about using Django as a piece of a web-app (and not a full MVC
Framework).
Good ideas also about cross-purposes using Django, Tornado and Backbone.js -
from chapter 4 to the end.
